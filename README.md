The sampling system is dumb as rocks.

There's an 7-bit counter attached to a clock. Every time a pulse comes
in, or the counter overflows, we sample the clock and send the result to the
low 7 bits of the DMA channel; the high bit is the pulse itself (allowing us
to distinguish between true pulses or counter overflows).

An HD floppy has a nominal clock of 500kHz, so we use a sample clock of 8MHz
(every 0.125us). This means that our 500kHz pulses will have an interval of
16 (and a DD disk with a 250kHz nominal clock has an interval of 32). This
gives us more than enough resolution. If no pulse comes in, then we sample on
rollover at 128 * 0.125us = 160us.

VERY IMPORTANT:

The READ DATA line on the PSOC is on pin 3[2], which has a integrated
capacitor! This needs to be removed before the device can see any floppy
drive data. It's C7, and is easy with some tweezers and a stead hand with
a soldering iron.

Some useful numbers:

  - nominal rotation speed is 300 rpm, or 5Hz. The period is 200ms.
  - MFM encoding uses a clock of 500kHz. This makes each recording cell 2us.
  - a pulse is 150ns to 800ns, so a clock of 7MHz will sample it.
